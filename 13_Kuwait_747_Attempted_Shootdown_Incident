*One of the primary sources of this video is considered partly unreliable, as it includes two photos of 
a crashed airplane that are presented as being the downed Iraqi 747. This is false, as the plane shown 
carries the liveries and logos of Kuwait Airways. Furthermore, it mixes recreated footage with footage 
of a original VHS, containing the footage of the incident.
